"Born in March to my mother, Melisa, my father, Brian, and two siblings, an older sister, Chali, and the middle child, Brandon. ","I Turn 18, stumbling out the door in my fifth year of high school. I am still not sure if the state of Nevada has deemed me a graduate. I may not have a diploma but am too afraid to ask as that could affect the current college credits I've acquired.","Never made a plan, was going to kill myself so never bothered plotting out my future. Moved in with my sister, Chali a year prior, helping raise my two nephews. I have my first kiss and lose my virginity in April 2018, after startting my first job at Little Caesars, where I met Serenity, my first girlfriend (to whom I lost my virginity). I had always lied and said I lost my virginity earlier, as boys do. ","I move to Reno around June with Serenity and drop out of community college, where I went to get an engineering degree. Reno is miserable for the both of us and Serenity was a bomb defusal, we had many fights and had broken up many times, eventually we moved back to Fallon where we eventually broke up on our one-year anniversary.","I drop out of community college for the second time, and returned to Little Caesars to become the Co-Manager with Gabe, a dear friend. In the meantime I met a girl named Morgan, whom I slept with then got afraid at how quickly she became interested in me and ghosted her (I still feel guilty, blame it on my lowsy upbringing). In June, I started dating Emily, and became the manager of little caesars. Emily moved in with me in October.","I lived with and dated Emily, working at Little Caesars with her until she eventually quit, but we worked together at the drug testing program run by my mother on the first weekend of every month. I quit Little Caesars in September and went on a trip to San Diego to see Emily's brother, Nick. ","I quit little caesars, and after losing all of my saved money trading cryptocurrency, I started a job as a production associate at Tesla. Emily and I broke up shortly after our two-year anniversary in June. I really loved her, so this marked a turning point in my life. I became re-motivated to pursue an engineering career within Tesla and applied for a job in equipment maintenance in december 2022. ","I've moved well into my position as an equipment maintenance tech, and I am using my newfound free time to learn new skills to help my career development, and working on self-improvement."
